Technical Support is available to all our clients who are enrolled in a Support Agreement with ProgressSoft, or whose software is still under warranty. Our software is offered with three months free-of-charge support commitment from ProgressSoft, starting from the date of the Software License release.

At the end of the free-of-charge support (warranty) period, clients sign a Support Agreement with ProgressSoft to enjoy the benefits of our support program. This Support Agreement covers all System Updates, which requires a separate deal with ProgressSoft.
